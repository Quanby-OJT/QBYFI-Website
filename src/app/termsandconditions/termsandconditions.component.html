                  This Agreement becomes effective upon credit approval and receipt
                  of payment for all application and other fees, as well as an
                  amount equivalent to one month of the Monthly Service Fee as an
                  advance payment (the &quot;Advance Payment&quot;). It remains
                  effective until the Service is terminated, without affecting other
                  ongoing subscriptions/accounts of the Subscriber using the
                  Service. The Service starts on the Service Commencement Date as
                  defined in Section 5 and is effective for twenty-four (24) months
                  thereafter (the &quot;lock-in period&quot;), unless terminated
                  early in accordance with Section 19. After the lock-in period, if
                  the Service has not been terminated, it will automatically renew
                  and continue on a month-to-month basis under the same terms and
                  conditions, subject to continued payment of the Monthly Service
                  Fee, until terminated by either Party. QBYFI reserves the right to
                  amend, change, or modify the applicable rates.

                QBYFI will install and connect the Optical Network Unit (ONU) with
                one activated port and one private IP address (one public IP for
                IBIZ only) and/or peripherals as soon as reasonably possible after
                credit approval and payment of all fees and the Advance Payment
                for the Service. QBYFI will provide the Subscriber with the
                necessary equipment and peripherals for Service access, as stated
                in the delivery and acknowledgment receipt issued to the
                Subscriber. These equipment and peripherals remain the property of
                QBYFI.

                Service Commencement Date & Start of Billing: The Service will be
                activated upon acceptance by the Subscriber. The Service is
                considered accepted after 24 hours of testing if there is no issue
                raised by the Subscriber. The day of activation is the Service
                Commencement Date for each Service. Billing will begin the day
                after activation. An Electronic Statement of Account will be sent
                to the Subscriber's active email provided during the application
                process or another email address provided to QBYFI, as well as via
                SMS.

                Billing and Payment: QBYFI will bill the Subscriber the Monthly
                Service Fee and other charges, which must be paid in full by the
                Subscriber on or before the Due Date indicated in the Statement of
                Account sent to the Subscriber's email address. If the Subscriber
                does not receive the Statement of Account for any reason, they
                agree to contact QBYFI's Customer Service Hotline or access the
                electronic file or site provided by QBYFI. It is assumed that the
                Subscriber has received the Statement of Account in due course.
                The Subscriber acknowledges that QBYFI may suspend the Service if
                any bill is not paid by the specified Due Date. QBYFI reserves the
                right to change the billing date or interval.

              <span>
                Billing Disputes: If the Subscriber disputes any portion of the
                Statement of Account, they must submit written documentation
                identifying and substantiating the disputed amount within fifteen
                (15) days of receiving the Statement of Account. If a dispute is not
                reported within this period, the billing will be deemed correct and
                final. Any disputed amount resolved in favor of the Subscriber will
                be credited to their account in the next Statement of Account. Any
                amount determined to be payable to QBYFI must be paid within seven
                (7) days of notification of the resolution. Failure to pay or
                provide supporting information in writing will result in the account
                being considered past due and unpaid, and QBYFI may pursue legal
                remedies, including suspension or disconnection of Service.

                Penalties: Late payment penalties will be charged at a rate of % per
                month for all accounts not paid by the Due Date. A fraction of a month
                will be considered as one (1) month for determining the penalty.

                QBYFI clarifies that the Service provided under this Agreement is
                solely for the use applied for. QBYFI reserves the right to determine
                if actual use aligns with the use applied for. Any unauthorized use
                of the Service is prohibited, and QBYFI may disconnect the Service
                without notice if the Subscriber violates this, forfeiting all sums
                received and claiming additional damages.

                its control, such as labor disturbances, equipment breakdowns,
                acts of God, or force majeure. The Subscriber agrees that in such
                cases, the operation of this Agreement and delivery of the Service
                may be suspended or terminated without notice or liability for
                loss and damage. QBYFI will not be liable for any loss or damage
                unless caused by the willful or grossly negligent act or omission
                of QBYFI's employees or agents, which liability will not exceed
                the Monthly Service Fee.

                Subscriber must pay the pre-termination fee. Relocation is allowed
                only if the Subscriber has no outstanding balance and other
                accounts are in good standing.

                Termination of Service: The Subscriber may terminate the
                subscription with one (1) month prior notice and payment of all
                outstanding obligations. If termination occurs during the lock-in
                period, a pre-termination fee and pro-rated bill will apply. QBYFI
                may terminate the Service for non-payment or violation of the
                Agreement, with the same pre-termination fee. The Subscriber
                authorizes QBYFI to retrieve ONU and/or Peripherals upon
                termination.
